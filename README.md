# place-notes
PlaceNotes is a position based note-taking application for iOS. A note is tied to the place where it 
was made, and can then only be accessed from that place. Use cases might include making notes of yummy 
dishes at restaurants, keeping track of PRs at the gym, or taking notes at work that you don't want to 
be stressed about at home.
